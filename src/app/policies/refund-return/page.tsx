            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Eligibility for Returns</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We accept returns for unused, undamaged items within 30 days from the date of delivery. To be eligible 
              for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with 
              tags, and in its original packaging. You must also have the receipt or proof of purchase.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Items that are damaged, used, installed, or altered in any way cannot be returned unless the damage 
              occurred during shipping or was a manufacturing defect. In such cases, please contact us immediately 
              to report the issue.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Non-Returnable Items</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Certain types of items cannot be returned, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <li>Custom-made or personalized items</li>
              <li>Special order items</li>
              <li>Installed or used products</li>
              <li>Items on sale or clearance (unless defective)</li>
              <li>Any product that is not in its original condition, is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Refund Process</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it and notify you of the status of your refund. 
              If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original payment method. You will 
              receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The time it takes for the refunded amount to appear in your account will depend on your payment 
              provider. For credit card refunds, it typically takes 5-10 business days for the funds to appear 
              in your account.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Refund Amount</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              You will receive a refund for the cost of the returned item(s). Original shipping charges are 
              non-refundable unless the return is due to an error on our part (incorrect or defective item). 
              Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the return is due to a defect 
              or our error.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Damaged Items During Shipping</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              If your item arrives damaged, please contact us immediately within 48 hours of delivery. Take photos 
              of the damage and packaging, and do not discard the packaging as it may be needed for insurance 
              claims. We will either send a replacement or process a refund based on your preference.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Incorrect Items</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              If you receive an incorrect item, please contact us immediately. We will arrange for the return of 
              the incorrect item at no cost to you and send the correct item as soon as possible. Alternatively,

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Warranty Claims</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Our products come with manufacturer warranties. If you experience a defect within the warranty period, 
              you may be eligible for repair, replacement, or refund depending on the nature of the defect and the 
              terms of the warranty. Contact our customer service team to initiate a warranty claim.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Exchanges</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We do not offer direct exchanges. To exchange an item, please return the original item for a refund 
              and place a new order for the desired item. If you need a different size, color, or style, this 
              process will be the fastest way to get what you need.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Shipping Costs for Returns</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              In most cases, customers are responsible for paying return shipping costs. However, if the return 
              is due to our error (incorrect or defective item), we will provide a prepaid return shipping label 
              and cover the cost. International returns may incur additional fees that will be deducted from the 
              refund.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Processing Time</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Once we receive your return, please allow 5-7 business days for processing. You will receive an 
              email notification once your return has been processed. The time it takes for the refunded amount 
              to appear in your account will depend on your payment provider.
